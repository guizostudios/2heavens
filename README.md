# 2heavens - A Decentralized Crypto Wealth Wallet
2heavens is a decentralized crypto wealth wallet built on the Celo blockchain. Our goal is to transform people's relationship with their wealth and inheritance through clarity of information about their crypto assets.

## Features
### TTOD (Token Transfer on Death) Smart Contract
Our product provides clarity about your crypto assets to your heirs. You can carry out the decision of your crypto assets through our functionality TTOD (Token Transfer on Death) which is a smart contract that your heirs can claim after you pass away. The smart contract includes a delay period before the assets are transferred to the heir, during which the owner can still prove that they are alive.

### Joint Wallet Smart Contract
Our Joint Wallet smart contract is designed to manage the funds of an account. It allows the owner of the contract to set a beneficiary and a delay time before the beneficiary can withdraw all the funds. The contract also has the ability to set a withdraw limit for specific ERC20 tokens and has reentrancy protection. Additionally, the contract includes functions to freeze and unfreeze the account, approve and check deposit approvals, make a deposit, and withdraw funds. Overall, this smart contract provides a secure and efficient way to manage funds and control access to them.

## Security
Our smart contracts are built with security in mind and use the OpenZeppelin "SafeERC20" and "SafeMath" libraries for added security and protection against overflow/underflow errors. Additionally, our contracts include event emitters for freezing and unfreezing and also have a mutex to prevent reentrancy attacks.

## How to Use
To use 2heavens, you will need to connect to the Celo blockchain using a wallet such as MetaMask. From there, you can interact with the TTOD and Joint Wallet smart contracts to manage your crypto assets and set up inheritance plans for your heirs.

## Conclusion
2heavens is a powerful tool for managing and inheriting your crypto assets in a secure and transparent way. We hope to make the process of managing and passing on crypto wealth easier and more efficient for everyone.

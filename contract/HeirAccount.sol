// The Accounts contract allows for the setting of an heir for an Celo account, and for the heir to claim the account after a certain delay.
// It also includes functions for freezing and unfreezing the account, and for depositing funds (either in CELO or an ERC20 token specified by address).
// The contract also imports OpenZeppelin's "SafeERC20" and "SafeMath" libraries for added security and protection against overflow/underflow errors.
// The contract also has a balanceOf function to check balance of CELO or ERC20 token.
// The constructor sets the owner of the contract to the address passed as an argument.
